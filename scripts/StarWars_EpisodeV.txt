    LUKE   Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you  read me? 
    HAN   Loud and clear, kid. What's up? 
    LUKE   Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any  life readings. 
    HAN   There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. 
    LUKE   Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite  that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. 
    LUKE   Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something? 
    LUKE   Aaargh! 
    HAN   Chewie! 
    HAN   All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand. 
    RIEEKAN   Solo? 
    HAN   No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around. 
    RIEEKAN   Commander Skywalker reported in yet? 
    HAN   No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. 
    RIEEKAN   With all the meteor activity in this  system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. 
    HAN   General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. 
    RIEEKAN   I'm sorry to hear that. 
    HAN   Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man. 
    RIEEKAN   A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good  fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. 
    HAN   Thank you, General. 
    HAN   Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. 
    LEIA   That's right. 
    HAN   Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. 
    LEIA   Han! 
    HAN   Yes, Your Highnessness? 
    LEIA   I thought you decided to stay. 
    HAN   Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my  mind. 
    LEIA   Han, we need you! 
    HAN   We? 
    LEIA   Yes. 
    HAN   Oh, what about you need?
