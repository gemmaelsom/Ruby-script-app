   THREEPIO   Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness! 
    THREEPIO   We're doomed! 
    THREEPIO   There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. 
    THREEPIO   What's that? 
    THREEPIO   I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister... 
    LUKE   Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear! 
    THREEPIO   Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? 
    THREEPIO   At last!  Where have you been? 
    THREEPIO   They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! 
    THREEPIO   Wait a minute, where are you going? 
    IMPERIAL OFFICER   The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. 
    VADER   Where are those transmissions you intercepted? 
    REBEL OFFICER   We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. 
    VADER   If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador? 
    VADER   Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive! 
    TROOPER   There she is! Set for stun! 
    TROOPER   She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. 
    THREEPIO   Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. 
    THREEPIO   Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you. 
    THREEPIO   Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there! 
    THREEPIO   I'm going to regret this. 
    CHIEF PILOT   There goes another one. 
    CAPTAIN   Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited. 
    THREEPIO   That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. 
    THREEPIO   Are you sure this things safe? 
    WOMAN   I've told you kids to slow down! 
    FIXER   Did I hear a young noise blast through here? 
    CAMIE   It was just Wormie on another rampage. 
    LUKE   Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs? 
    LUKE   I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?
