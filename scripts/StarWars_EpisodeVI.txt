    SHUTTLE CAPTAIN   Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. 
    DEATH STAR CONTROLLER   The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. 
    SHUTTLE CAPTAIN   We're starting our approach. 
    OFFICER   Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. 
    OPERATOR   Yes, sir. 
    JERJERROD   Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.  We're honored by your presence. 
    VADER   You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. 
    JERJERROD   I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. 
    VADER   Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. 
    JERJERROD   I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. 
    VADER   The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. 
    JERJERROD   But he asks the impossible. I need more men. 
    VADER   Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. 
    JERJERROD   The Emperor's coming here? 
    VADER   That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. 
    JERJERROD   We shall double our efforts. 
    VADER   I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 
    THREEPIO   Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. 
    THREEPIO   Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit. 
    THREEPIO   Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. 
    THREEPIO   There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. 
    STRANGE VOICE   Tee chuta hhat yudd! 
    THREEPIO   Goodness gracious me! 
    THREEPIO   Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. 
    THREEPIO   I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. 
    THREEPIO   Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. 
    THREEPIO   Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me! 
    THREEPIO   Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. 
    BIB   Die Wanna Wanga! 
    THREEPIO   Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.
